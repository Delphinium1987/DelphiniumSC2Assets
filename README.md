# DelphiniumSC2Assets
This is the assets mod project of Team Froggy&Catty. 
All our assets are open source and you can use them freely in Non-commercial SC2 projects. It's our pleasure that SC2 modders can use these assets in your projects and bring excellent arcade games to players all around the world.

Delphinium_Model_1.0.SC2Mod contains our original assets of Blizzard Enforcement project. Now we don't have plans to modify it (or the players will need to redownload the mod.)
Delphinium_Model_Patch_1.0.SC2mod is the addtional part of Delphinium_Model_1.0.SC2Mod, Contains the error fixing for Delphinium_Model_1.0.SC2Mod and many new assets, the assets we made for Skyfall project are also included. we'll keep updating new assets to it until it's huge enough just like the first one, then we'll move to the next patch mod.

The entire asset library is too huge to make a photograph index, but you can see some showcases of our works here: https://delphiniumkey.deviantart.com

We are welcome that all SC2 modders around the world can use our works to bring new and cool arcade games. You can use the entire mods as well as export and repack the assets by yourself. But please note that these assets are licensed for non-commercial use only. We made these assets to help community and modders, but we don't want someone to take up our works for their own commercial interests.

(As an exceptional case) To help and support Blizzard current Premium Arcade Project, if your arcade game has join this project, we'd like to abandon all our potential commercial interests to dispel your scruples during your negotiation between you and Blizzard. Don't worry, we only wish your success.
